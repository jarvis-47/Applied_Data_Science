# Applied_Data_Science

## Course Description:
* Use Python and other tools to scrape, clean and process data
* Use visualization techniques to explore data and communicate results
* Implement basic machine learning algorithms on data, and interpret their output for inference and prediction
* Examine and compare the performance of different data science models, and select a best performing model for an application
* Design a study to investigate the applicability and performance of various data science models for a given data set
* Use local and cloud-based high performance computing resources
* Report the results of a data analysis effectively (visually, verbally, and in writing), and defend the validity of results with respect to model performance and selected methods
