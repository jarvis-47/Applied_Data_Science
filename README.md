# Applied_Data_Science

## Course Description:
• Use Python and other tools to scrape, clean and process data 
• Use visualization techniques to explore data and communicate results 
• Implement basic machine learning algorithms on data, and interpret their output for inference and prediction 
• Examine and compare the performance of different data science models, and select a best performing model for an application 
• Design a study to investigate the applicability and performance of various data science models for a given data set 
• Use local and cloud-based high performance computing resources 
• Report the results of a data analysis effectively (visually, verbally, and in writing), and defend the validity of results with respect to model performance and selected methods
